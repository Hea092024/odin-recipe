    <h1>The Best Chicken Fried Steak</h1>
    <h3>This chicken fried steak recipe is one I received from a co-worker about 5 years. <br> A Southern favorite, these crispy, breaded, tenderized cube steaks drenched in creamy gravy can be served for breakfast or dinner. <br> It's by far the best chicken fried steak I've ever had. <br> I've made this numerous times for my picky son and my Southern-raised better half, as well as for other family and friends and each time, I get nothing but rave reviews.</h3>
